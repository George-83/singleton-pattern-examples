# Singleton Pattern Examples

This repository contains **simple and comparable implementations of the Singleton design pattern**
in **four programming languages**:

- TypeScript
- Python
- C#
- Java

The goal of this project is **educational** — to demonstrate how the same design pattern
is implemented idiomatically in different languages, highlighting similarities and differences
in syntax, language features, and conventions.

---

## 📌 What is Singleton?

The **Singleton pattern** ensures that a class has:

- **only one instance**
- a **global access point** to that instance

It is commonly used for:
- shared application state
- configuration
- authentication/session state
- caches
- test automation utilities

---

## 📂 Structure

Each language has its own minimal implementation with similar behavior.

---

All implementations:
- prevent external instantiation
- store a simple shared state (e.g. token/auth state)
- are intentionally kept **simple and readable**

---

## ⚠️ Notes

- These implementations are **not meant to be production-ready**
- Thread safety is intentionally ignored in some versions to keep the examples minimal
- The focus is on **learning and comparison**, not on edge cases

---

## 🎯 Intended Use

- Learning design patterns
- Comparing languages (TypeScript vs Python vs C# vs Java)
- Test automation examples
- Reference for beginners and intermediate developers
